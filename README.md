# CryptographyCiphers

Things to note for Shift Cipher:

  (The program encrypts according to the Shift Cipher, also known as Ceasar Cipher)

  - Here, you can enter any sentence or word in order to encrypt it according to a randomly generated key that is different every time the program is run.
  - You can also decrypt a given encoded phrase given that you know the key, if you dont know the key you can still try inputting all possible 25 keys to see which one gives a            sensible output (not recommended though, mainly only use this mode when you know the key)
  
  You are able to use two modes: 
  
  i) Encrypt Mode: Enter any text to see it get encrypted according to the random key selected by the program
  ii) Decrypt Mode: Enter a key and encoded text to see it get decrypted according to the key you provided
  
  Enter 'd' to switch to Decrypt Mode or 'e' to switch to Encrypt Mode when asked
  
  You can enter "exit" at any time to exit the program
