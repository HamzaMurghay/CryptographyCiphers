# CryptographyCiphers

Things to note for Shift Cipher Program:

  (The program encrypts according to the Shift Cipher, also known as Ceasar Cipher)

  - Here, you can enter any sentence or word in order to encrypt it according to a randomly generated key that is different every time the program is run.
  - You can also decrypt a given encoded phrase given that you know the key, if you dont know the key you can still try inputting all possible 25 keys to see which one gives a            sensible output (not recommended though, mainly only use this mode when you know the key)
    
  - At the start of the program it will ask you if you want to use different keys for lowercase letters and uppercase letters, if you chose yes, this will apply to both encryption        and decryption (During encryption, the program will generate two random keys for lower and uppercase letters and use those, in decryption, you will have to input two keys, one        for lowercase and the other for uppercase letters)
  
  You are able to use two modes: 
  
  i) Encrypt Mode: Enter any text to see it get encrypted according to the random key selected by the program
  
  ii) Decrypt Mode: Enter a key and encoded text to see it get decrypted according to the key you provided
  
  Enter 'd' to switch to Decrypt Mode or 'e' to switch to Encrypt Mode when asked to change mode
  
  You can enter "exit" at any time to exit the program
